[x] XSD creating experince

1. While Creating xsd file , I understood the concept of complex type and how the sequence works and how we begin creating
   xsd file by creaing an element and as in our case "catalog" is the parent element within which we have many child elements therefore we can say it has complex type and if we want to put all the child elements in the proper order as they are shown in xml file , we use sequence type by providing it attributes and attributes are basically name and type (string , int , float , double).

2. So as long as i understood while creating dtd file , it is basically a xml declaration which is used to define xml language precisely and in a structured way and it contains elements.
