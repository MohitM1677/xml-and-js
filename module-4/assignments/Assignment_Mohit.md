Create `module-4/assignments/assignment_YOURNAME.md` and explain your thought process in it. Add screenshots of each step to the file

- It was not something which i did earlier as a lot of brainstorming took place while creating the files as the data was in nested form also and as long as rendering m for Men and w for Women is concerned so it required conditions like if. So, overall experience was good and the learning curve is also increasing.
